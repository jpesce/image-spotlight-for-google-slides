# Privacy Policy  
_Last updated: May 18, 202_

This Privacy Policy explains how your data is (or is not) collected, used, and protected when you use the Chrome extension.

## 1. Information We Collect
We do **not** collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information (PII).

The extension operates entirely on your local machine and does not send any data to external servers.

## 2. Permissions and Usage
The extension requests the following permissions:

- **`activeTab`** â€“ Allows the extension to temporarily interact with the currently active Google Slides tab to enable the spotlight effect.  
- **`storage`** â€“ Used to save local settings/preferences (e.g., whether to log debug information to the console). This data remains on your device only.  
- **Host access to `https://docs.google.com/presentation/*`** â€“ Necessary to inject the spotlight functionality into Google Slides. No other sites are accessed.

These permissions are used **solely** to provide the extension's single, clearly defined functionality: spotlighting images in Google Slides presentations.

## 3. Data Sharing
We do **not** share or sell any data. No user data is collected, stored, or transmitted.

## 4. Third-Party Services
This extension does not use any third-party services, trackers, or analytics tools.

## 5. Children's Privacy
This extension is not directed at children under 13, but it does not contain any content that would be inappropriate for them. No data is collected from any user, regardless of age.

## 6. Changes to This Policy
This policy may be updated in the future to reflect changes in functionality or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
